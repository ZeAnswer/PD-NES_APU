# PD-NES_APU

***
WORK IN PROGRESS
***

The NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) has a very unique and nostalgic sound which is generated by its APU (Audio Processing Unit).
This is an attempt to recreate that sound by emulating the APU as closely as I can. 
This will be done in Puredata which allows us to have a visual understanding of the inner-workings of this APU.

Greatly influenced by the work of aselker in https://github.com/aselker/gameboy-sound-chip
